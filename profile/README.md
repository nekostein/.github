## About Us

Nekostein is an unincorporated game development team consiting of Neruthes and MIAO_OAIM.

For more information, see our website [https://nekostein.com/](https://nekostein.com/).



## Wave Function

We are developing our first game **Wave Function** ([https://nekoste.in/+wf](https://nekoste.in/+wf)) which is expected to be released in November 2023
on Steam for Windows (and probably Linux and Mac as well).

Wave Function is a puzzle game about quantum physics.
You will do the double-slit experiment and adjust parameters; the interference stripes you produce will determine your score.
You must satisfy brightness sensors with peaks and darkness sensors with valleys.
